Tanasi Digital Asset Blockchain (TDA)

> A people-backed digital asset rooted in Indigenous labor, sacrifice, and sovereign continuity




---

📌 Overview

Tanasi Digital Asset (TDA) is a sovereign-aligned blockchain project backed by the sweat, blood, and tears of Indigenous peoples born of North and South America—the real, lived labor and sacrifice that built, sustained, and defended these lands across generations.

The project is sponsored by the Red Wolf River Nation (RWRN) and officially endorsed by Aeon Chief Cito Vincent Pellegra.

> Physical Tanasi currency will be introduced later to reinforce the asset—not to define it.



TDA asserts that human labor, sacrifice, and continuity precede money, and that blockchain should reflect this truth.

🐺 Sponsorship & Authority

Sponsoring Nation: Red Wolf River Nation (RWRN)

Endorsing Authority: Aeon Chief Cito Vincent Pellegra

Cultural Origin: Tanasi — a historic nexus of trade, endurance, and unity


TDA exists under sovereign stewardship, not corporate extraction.

🧬 Foundational Backing Model

People Before Currency

Unlike fiat or algorithmic systems, Tanasi Digital Asset is initially backed by:

Generational labor of Indigenous peoples

Displacement, survival, and endurance under colonization

Agricultural, industrial, military, and civic contribution

Cultural preservation against erasure

Sweat, blood, and tears as economic truth


This backing is non-transferable, non-exploitable, and non-liquidatable.
It represents historical value already paid.

> The blockchain records value; the people created it.

💠 Future Reinforcement: Physical Currency (Phase II)

Physical Tanasi currency will be introduced in a later phase to:

Anchor the digital asset with tangible reserves

Support trade and exchange mechanisms

Strengthen liquidity without redefining origin

Act as reinforcement, not replacement, of human-backed value


Sequence matters:

1. People


2. Ledger


3. Currency



Not the reverse.
